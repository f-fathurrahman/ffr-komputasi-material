The programs elec_md.f and nucl_md.f correspond to sections
9.3.1 and 9.3.2 respectively.
The first program outputs the energies during the md simulation 
to the screen.
The second one outputs the distances between the nuclei to a file 
"distances". It furthermore outputs energy, force between the 
nuclei, and distance to the screen.

Both programs are created using the Makefile.
