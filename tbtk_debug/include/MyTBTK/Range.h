/** @brief One-dimensional range.
 *
 *  The Range can be used to define a one-dimensional interval. It has a lower
 *  and upper bound, an is resolved with a number of points. A Range is created
 *  using
 *  ```cpp
 *    Range range(LOWER_BOUND, UPPER_BOUND, RESOLUTION);
 *  ```
 *
 *  # Bounds
 *  By default the bounds are included in the Range. But it is possible to
 *  exclude one or both bounds by passing two add boolean flags to the
 *  constructor. The first and second flag indicates whether the lower and
 *  upper bounds are included, respectively.
 *
 *  # Example
 *  \snippet Utilities/Range.cpp Range
 *  ## Output
 *  \snippet output/Utilities/Range.txt Range */
