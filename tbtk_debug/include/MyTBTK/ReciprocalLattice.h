/** The ReciprocalLattice provides methods for constructing momentum space
 *  Models from a UnitCell. Let the real space Hamiltonian be written on the
 *  form
 *  \f[
 *	H = \sum_{RiR'i'}a_{RiR'i'}c_{Ri'}^{\dagger}c_{R'i'},
 *  \f]
 *  where R and R' are UnitCell-indices and i and i' are intra
 *  UnitCell-indices. Expanding the operators in the momentum basis we have
 *  \f[
 *	H = \sum_{RkiR'k'i'}a_{RiR'i'}c_{ki}^{\dagger}c_{k'i'}e^{i(k\cdot R - k'\cdot R')}.
 *  \f]
 *  Now assuming translational invaraince, such that the coefficients only
 *  depend on the relative UnitCell positions, we can write
 *  \f[
 *	H = \sum_{\bar{R}kiR'k'i'}a_{\bar{R}i0i'}c_{ki}^{\dagger}c_{k'i'}e^{ik\cdot\bar{R}}e^{i(k-k')\cdot R'},
 *  \f]
 *  where \f[\bar{R} = R - R'\f].
 *  Carrying out the sum over R' we arrive at
 *  \f[
 *	H = \sum_{kik'i'}\left(\sum_{\bar{R}}a_{\bar{R}i0i'}e^{ik\cdot\bar{R}}\right)c_{ki}^{\dagger}c_{k'i'}.
 *  \f]
 *  It therefore follows that the momentum space HoppingAmplitudes are given by
 *  \f[
 *	a_{kik'i'} = \sum_{\bar{R}}a_{\bar{R}i0i'}e^{ik\cdot\bar{R}}.
 *  \f]
 *  The purpose of this class is to provide method for constructing Models for
 *  given k and k' using these coefficients. This is done by specifying a real
 *  space environment around a reference UnitCell, large enough to ensure that
 *  the sum can run over all relevant \f[\bar{R}\f], and then using this to
 *  calcualte the coefficeints when Models with given k and k' is demanded.
