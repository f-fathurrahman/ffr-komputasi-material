/** @brief Square lattice model.
 *
 *  The Square lattice allows for nearest-neighbor or next nearest-neighbor
 *  Models on a square lattice to be set up easily. A Model with the side
 *  lengths SIZE_X and SIZE_Y is created as follows.
 *  ```cpp
 *    Model model = Models::SquareLattice({SIZE_X, SIZE_Y}, {U, t, tp});
 *  ```
 *  Here U is the on-site potential, t is the nearest neighbor hopping
 *  amplitude, and tp is an optional next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude.
 *
 *  It is also possible to create a spinful model by adding a IDX_SPIN flag as
 *  follows.
 *  ```cpp
 *    Model model = Models::SquareLattice(
 *      {SIZE_X, SIZE_Y, IDX_SPIN},
 *      {U, t, tp}
 *    );
 *  ```
 *
 *  The resulting Model has not yet been *constructed*, which means that it is
 *  possible to add further @link HoppingAmplitude HoppingAmplitudes@endlink to
 *  it. Before using it, remember to call
 *  ```cpp
 *    model.construct();
 *  ``` */
