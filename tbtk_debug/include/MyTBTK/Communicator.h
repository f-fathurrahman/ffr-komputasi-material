/** @brief Base class for classes that can communicate their status during
 *  execution.
 *
 *  The communicator allows for both the global verbosity and the verbosity of
 *  individual objects to be modified. A class that inherits from Communicator
 *  is provided with two functions for setting and getting its verbosity.
 *  Setting the verbosity to true means the object may output text to the
 *  Streams during execution.
 *
 *  The Communicator class also provides two static functions for setting the
 *  verbosity globally. If the global verbosity set to false, no information
 *  should be written to the Streams even if the individual objects have their
 *  verbosity set to true. To respect this behavior, classes that derive from
 *  the communicator should enclose any output to Streams with the statement
 *  ```cpp
 *    if(getVerbose() && Streams::getGlobalVerbose()){
 *      //Output to Streams here
 *      //...
 *    }
 *  ```
 *
 *  *Note: Error messages should not be muted.*
