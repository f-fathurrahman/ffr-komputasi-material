/** Streams for MyTBTK output.
 *
 *  The Streams class provides global functions for streaming text output. By
 *  default the information is written to stdout and atderr, but the Streams
 *  class allows for more customized output. All text output from MyTBTK is
 *  written through the Stream interface, and can therefore be customized
 *  through it.
 *
 *  # Streams::out
 *  This is the standard output in MyTBTK. By default, information written to
 *  Streams::out is forwarded to std::cout and Streams::log.
 *
 *  # Streams::err
 *  This is the error output in MyTBTK. By default, information written to
 *  Streams::err is forwarded to std::err and Streams::log.
 *
 *  # Streams::log
 *  This is the logged output in MyTBTK. By default, the log does not write to
 *  anything. However, The two commands
 *  ```cpp
 *    Streams::openLog("LogFilename");
 *  ```
 *  and
 *  ```cpp
 *    Streams::closeLog();
 *  ```
 *  can be used to open and close a log file to which everything is written.
 *
 *  When the log is opened, a time stamp, version number, and git hash for the
 *  currently installed version of MyTBTK is added to the output. Similarly, a
 *  time stamp is added when the log is closed. This makes it easy to document
 *  the exact setup used to perform a calculation and provides a way for
 *  ensuring that the results will be possible to reproduce any time in the
 *  future. */
