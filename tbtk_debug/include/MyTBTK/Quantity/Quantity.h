/** @brief Base class for @link Quantity Quantitis@endlink.
 *
 *  A Quantity is a Real number that carries compile time information about
 *  units. While it is possible to create Quantity object, their main purpose
 *  is to act as template parameter for the UnitHandler functions.
 *
 *  # Defining new Quantities
 *  *Note: The Quantity template is not meant to be instatiated directly.
 *  Instead the Base and Derived classes that inherit from Quantity are meant
 *  to be instatiated. However, the syntax for instantiating such Quantities is
 *  the same as instantiating a Quantity directly. The instantiation procedure
 *  is therefore outlined here.*
 *
 *  ## Units and exponents
 *  To instantiate a Quantity, we first need to define a set of units for the
 *  Quantity. This is done with the help of an enum class.
 *  ```cpp
 *    enum class VoltageUnit {V, mV};
 *  ```
 *  We also need to define the exponents for the base units Angle, Charge,
 *  Count, Energy, Length, Temperature, and Time. In the case of voltage, this
 *  is V = J/C, or Energy/Charge.
 *  ```cpp
 *    enum class Voltage{
 *      Angle = 0,
 *      Charge = -1,
 *      Count = 0,
 *      Energy = 1,
 *      Length = 0,
 *      Temperature = 0,
 *      Time = 0
 *    };
 *  ```
 *  Having defined these two enum classes, we can define Voltage using
 *  ```cpp
 *    typedef Quantity<VoltageUnit, VoltageExponent> Voltage;
 *  ```
 *  <b>Note that when instantiating Base and Derived units, Quantity in the
 *  line above is replaced by Base and Derived, respectively.</b>
 *
 *  With these definitions, the following symbols that are relevant for
 *  UnitHandler calls are defined:
 *  - Quantity::Voltage
 *  - Quantity::Voltage::Unit::V
 *  - Quantity::Voltage::Unit::mV
 *
 *  ## Creating and initializing a conversion table
 *  We also need to define a table that can be used to convert between string
 *  and enum class representations of the units. The conversion table should
 *  also contain a conversion factor that specifies the amount in the given
 *  unit that corresponds to a single unit of the Quantity in the default base
 *  units. The default base units are rad, C, pcs, eV, m, K, and s.
 *
 *  The unit for voltage is V = J/C = 1.602176634e-19. We can therefore define
 *  the conversion table as follows.
 *  ```cpp
 *    Quantity<
 *      VoltageUnit,
 *      VoltageExponent
 *    >::ConversionTable Quantity<
 *      VoltageUnit,
 *      VoltageExponent
 *    >::conversionTable({
 *      {Quantity::Voltage::Unit::V, {"V", 1.602176634e-19}},
 *      {Quantity::Voltage::Unit::mV, {"mV", 1.602176634e-19*1e3}},
 *    });
 *  ```
 *    <b>Notes:
 *      - This definition has to be made in a .cpp-file to avoid multiple
 *      definitions.
 *      - Even though Quantities should be instantiated from the Base and
 *      Derived classes, this definition should always contain the keyword
 *      Quantity. Note the difference with the typedef above, where Quantity is
 *      to be replaced by Base or Derived.
 *      - It is only possible to initialize the conversion table as is done
 *      above if the numerical constants are specified as numbers or using
 *      variables defined in the same translation unit (source file). It can be
 *      used when defining custom Derived units. However, the Base and Derived
 *      Quantities defined in MyTBTK uses constants from Constants instead of
 *      specifying numerical values directly. These values are not available
 *      until Constants have been initialized. The conversion table definition
 *      and initialization is therefore separated into two parts as described
 *      below.
 *
 *    </b>
 *
 *  The conversionTable is defined as follows. (Note the empty curly brace,
 *  these are necessary to ensure that the conversion table is created.)
 *  ```cpp
 *    Quantity<
 *      VoltageUnit,
 *      VoltageExponent
 *    >::ConversionTable Quantity<
 *      VoltageUnit,
 *      VoltageExponent
 *    >::conversionTable({});
 *  ```
 *  The following code is then put into the function
 *  *initializeDerivedQuantities()* to initialize the conversion table.
 *  ```cpp
 *    Voltage::conversionTable = Voltage::ConversionTable({
 *      {Voltage::Unit::V, {"V", 1.602176634e-19}},
 *      {Voltage::Unit::mV, {"mV", 1.602176634e-19*1e3}},
 *    });
 *  ```
 *  The conversion tables for Base units are similarly initialized in
 *  *initializeBaseQuantities()*.
 *
 *  It is not possible to define custom Derived units and initialize them from
 *  another function that *initializeDerivedQuantities()*. Custom defined
 *  Derived units therefore either have to be defined using hard coded
 *  constants or be defined by extending the Derived.h and Derived.cpp files
 *  directly.
 *
 *  # Conversion
 *  ## Unit string to unit
 *
 *  ```cpp
 *    Quantity::Voltage::Unit unit = Quantity::Voltage::getUnit("V");
 *  ```
 *  ## Unit to unit string
 *
 *  ```cpp
 *    std::string unitString
 *      = Quantity::Voltage::getUnitString(Quantity::Voltage::Unit::V);
 *  ```
 *  ## Get conversion factor from the default base units to the given unit
 *  ```cpp
 *    double conversionFactor
 *      = Quantity::Voltage::getConversionFactor(Quantity::Voltage::Unit::V);
 *  ```
