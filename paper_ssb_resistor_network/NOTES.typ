In this work, we propose a simple resistor network model
describing transport in solid-state battery electrode composites based
on simple voxel structures that is then benchmarked against
experimental transport in NCM83-LPSCl cathode composites.

A schematic
two-dimensional representation of a typical solid-state composite
cathode microstructure in comparison to a voxel microstructure
analogue is shown Fig. 1.

Despite this simplification, essential concepts
like tortuosity and domain size are reflected by the model.

Concluding the experimental characterization and microstructure-based transport
simulations of the ionic, electronic, and thermal transport properties
of the NCM83-LPSCl system, the proposed microstructural transport
model is tested against literature data to show its capability to predict
transport of other composite systems.

The results show that the model
can easily be modified and extended to other systems and research
questions.

Using the resistor network model provides experimentalists
a new tool to fast find the range of optimized solid-state battery
compositions - without the need for much computational resources.
