! PROGRAM GS
! ==========
!
! This program obtains solves the ground state DFT problem, i.e. it solves the
! Kohn-Sham equations. The result is a file called "wfs" where the ground
! state orbitals are placed, which may then be used by "td" or "excitations",
! to perform TDDFT calculations.

  ! calculated. The allocates the wfs variable, that holds the wavefunctions
  ! throught all the program.

  ! This is the core of the program, the self-consistent field cycle that
